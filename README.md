## What is this $NICE? 
$Nice guys is the deflationary utility BEP20 token that powers the [NiceGuys](https://niceguys.care) ecosystem.  

## Tokenomics 
Initial token supply is 1 trillion. After contract was deployed 31% of the supply was burned to create a 690B total supply. 

Upon transfers() function getting called 5% of the token amount is reflected back to holders and 5% is added back to liquidity. 

## How do I run and test my own fork of NiceGuys contract? 
Functions can be called via remix directly or CLI interactions via truffle. You'll have to deploy first either on a local network or the official BSC testnet. 

## Can NiceGuys team still modify the contract? 
No after project is deployed the code becomes immutable. We are unable to even write to contract anymore as we have renounced ownership.
